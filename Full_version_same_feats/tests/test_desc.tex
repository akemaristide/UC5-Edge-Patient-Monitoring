\section{IoT Gateway Testing Suite}
\label{sec:testing-suite}

To comprehensively evaluate the performance and reliability of our P4-based IoT gateway for patient monitoring, we developed a suite of four specialized tests. Each test targets specific aspects of system behavior under different operational conditions.

\subsection{Test Architecture Overview}
\label{subsec:test-architecture}

The testing framework utilizes custom packet structures that mirror the production system's EtherType definitions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sensor packets} (EtherType 0x1235): Contain patient ID, sensor ID, timestamp, and feature values
    \item \textbf{Alert packets} (EtherType 0x1236): Carry ML predictions including sepsis risk, NEWS2 scores, and heart failure indicators
\end{itemize}

Tests are executed from a monitoring host connected to the IoT gateway via dual USB-Ethernet adapters, simulating the production network topology. The Scapy library handles packet crafting and capture, while SSH-based monitoring provides real-time gateway resource utilization metrics.

\subsection{Latency Test}
\label{subsec:latency-test}

\textbf{Objective:} Measure end-to-end processing latency for complete and partial sensor data windows.

\textbf{Methodology:} The latency test evaluates two distinct processing pathways:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complete windows}: Transmission of all 10 sensor values triggers immediate P4 inference
    \item \textbf{Partial windows}: Transmission of 4-8 sensor values invokes the 60-second timeout mechanism
\end{enumerate}

The test sends 10 complete and 5 partial windows with 2-second intervals between patients. Precise timestamps capture the duration from first sensor packet transmission to alert packet reception. Inter-sensor delays of 10ms simulate realistic data acquisition timing.

\textbf{Key Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Processing latency (milliseconds)
    \item ML prediction accuracy rates
    \item Statistical consistency (standard deviation, percentiles)
    \item Timeout mechanism reliability
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Results:} Complete windows should exhibit sub-second latency (\textless 1000ms), while partial windows should demonstrate consistent timeout behavior (60,000-75,000ms).

\subsection{Performance Test}
\label{subsec:performance-test}

\textbf{Objective:} Determine maximum sustainable patient throughput and identify system bottlenecks.

\textbf{Methodology:} The performance test evaluates system behavior under increasing load by testing progressively higher patient rates (10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320+ patients per minute). Each rate is sustained for 120 seconds to achieve stable measurements.

The test implements a realistic workload composition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 90\% complete sensor windows (immediate processing)
    \item 10\% partial sensor windows (timeout processing)
    \item Mixed patient conditions (normal, sepsis, heart failure)
\end{itemize}

Real-time gateway monitoring via SSH captures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item System CPU and memory utilization
    \item BMv2 process resource consumption
    \item P4 switch responsiveness
    \item Network interface statistics
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Actual vs. target throughput rates
    \item Alert reception success rates
    \item Gateway resource utilization trends
    \item System breaking point identification
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scalability Test}
\label{subsec:scalability-test}

\textbf{Objective:} Assess the system's capacity to simultaneously monitor multiple concurrent patients.

\textbf{Methodology:} The scalability test simulates realistic long-term patient monitoring by creating concurrent patient threads. Each virtual patient operates independently, sending sensor data at intervals ranging from 30-300 seconds to mimic actual hospital monitoring patterns.

The test progresses through increasing patient counts (10, 20, 30, ..., 100) with each configuration sustained for 240 seconds. Patient threads generate mixed clinical conditions and varying sensor completeness patterns.

Success rate calculation:
\begin{equation}
\text{Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Patients Generating Alerts}}{\text{Total Patients}} \times 100\%
\end{equation}

Testing terminates when success rates drop below 80\%, indicating system capacity limits.

\textbf{Key Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum concurrent patient capacity
    \item Success rate degradation patterns  
    \item Alert generation rates per patient count
    \item Long-term system stability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timeout Test}
\label{subsec:timeout-test}

\textbf{Objective:} Validate system behavior with incomplete sensor data and timeout mechanism reliability.

\textbf{Methodology:} The timeout test systematically evaluates 10 distinct incomplete data scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sequential sensor omissions (missing 1, 2, 3+ sensors)
    \item Critical-only sensor sets (vital signs only)
    \item Random missing sensor patterns
    \item Minimal data cases (single sensor)
\end{itemize}

Each scenario is replicated 3 times across 3 test runs (27 total measurements per scenario) to ensure statistical validity. The test verifies that incomplete windows consistently trigger the 60-second timeout mechanism followed by controller heartbeat processing.

\textbf{Key Metrics:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timeout consistency (60,000-75,000ms range)
    \item ML prediction accuracy with missing data
    \item Sensor importance hierarchy identification
    \item Clinical decision support reliability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Execution and Analysis}
\label{subsec:test-execution}

All tests incorporate comprehensive error handling, progress monitoring, and automated result generation. Output includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CSV datasets with timestamped measurements
    \item Statistical analysis summaries
    \item Performance visualization plots
    \item System resource utilization reports
\end{itemize}

The complete test suite requires approximately 90 minutes for full execution, generating detailed performance characterizations suitable for production deployment planning and system optimization.

Tests are designed to identify system limitations before deployment, ensuring reliable patient monitoring under diverse operational conditions while maintaining clinical decision support accuracy and timeliness.

\subsection{Test Results and Key Insights}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Key Performance Insights}

The latency test results reveal several critical insights about system performance:

\textbf{Dual Processing Architecture Efficiency:} The system demonstrates a clear bifurcation in processing latency. Complete sensor windows (10 sensors) trigger immediate P4-based inference with a mean latency of 522.32ms, while partial windows invoke the timeout mechanism with consistent 60-75 second processing delays. This dual-path architecture ensures both rapid response for complete data and reliable processing of incomplete sensor sets.

\textbf{Processing Consistency:} The remarkably low standard deviation (20.54ms) for complete window processing indicates highly predictable system behavior. With 95\% of responses occurring within 553.22ms, the system demonstrates the consistency required for real-time clinical decision support.

\textbf{Timeout Mechanism Reliability:} All partial window processing (5/5, 100\%) fell within the expected 60-75 second range, demonstrating perfect timeout mechanism operation. This reliability is crucial for ensuring no patient data is lost due to incomplete sensor readings.

\textbf{ML Model Clinical Accuracy:} The machine learning components show strong clinical performance with 86.7\% sepsis detection sensitivity and 93.3\% accuracy in high-risk NEWS2 scoring. These rates exceed typical clinical decision support thresholds, indicating the models are well-calibrated for production deployment.

\textbf{Edge Computing Feasibility:} Sub-second latency for complete inference (522ms average) on IoT gateway hardware validates the feasibility of edge-based clinical decision support. This performance enables real-time patient monitoring without dependence on cloud connectivity.

The combination of rapid processing for complete data, reliable handling of incomplete data, and high ML prediction accuracy demonstrates that the P4-based IoT gateway architecture successfully addresses the key requirements for clinical patient monitoring systems: speed, reliability, and clinical accuracy.

\subsubsection{Timeout Behavior Analysis}

The timeout test systematically evaluated system behavior under incomplete sensor data conditions, validating both the timeout mechanism reliability and ML model robustness with missing information.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Timeout Mechanism Key Insights}

The timeout behavior analysis reveals sophisticated system intelligence in handling incomplete sensor data:

\textbf{Perfect Binary Threshold Detection:} The system demonstrates crystal-clear decision logic with complete sensor sets (10 sensors) processed in 545ms via direct inference, while any incomplete set triggers the timeout mechanism with consistent 62-72 second processing times. This binary behavior eliminates ambiguous edge cases.

\textbf{Robust Timeout Consistency:} All timeout scenarios fall within the expected 60-75 second range, with a narrow variance of ±5 seconds across diverse missing data patterns. This consistency validates the reliability of the controller heartbeat mechanism and ensures predictable system behavior.

\textbf{Intelligent ML Degradation:} The machine learning models exhibit sophisticated behavior based on sensor availability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{High completeness (7-10 sensors):} Maintains 100\% sepsis detection and high NEWS2 scores (8.3-12.0)
    \item \textbf{Moderate completeness (4-6 sensors):} Selective prediction based on sensor criticality
    \item \textbf{Low completeness (1-3 sensors):} Appropriately conservative with minimal clinical scoring
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sensor Criticality Hierarchy:} Results reveal clear sensor importance stratification. The "No\_Critical" scenario (6 sensors, excluding vital signs) maintained 100\% sepsis detection, while "Critical\_Only" (4 sensors, vital signs only) showed 0\% detection. This indicates that breadth of sensor coverage is more important than depth for this ML model.

\textbf{Clinical Safety Through Conservative Prediction:} When insufficient data is available (≤5 sensors), the system appropriately reduces prediction confidence rather than generating potentially false alerts. NEWS2 scores decrease proportionally with data availability (12.0 → 5.0 → 2.3), demonstrating clinically appropriate conservatism.

\textbf{Production Reliability:} The timeout mechanism's 100\% success rate across all scenarios, combined with intelligent ML degradation, ensures that no patient data is lost while maintaining clinical decision support quality appropriate to the available information.

This timeout behavior validates the system's suitability for real-world clinical deployment, where sensor failures and incomplete data are common occurrences that must be handled gracefully without compromising patient safety.

\subsection{Enhanced Testing Framework}

Building upon the initial performance evaluation, several advanced testing methodologies were developed to comprehensively assess the IoT gateway's capabilities under various operational scenarios. These enhanced tests provide deeper insights into system behavior, scalability limits, and real-world performance characteristics.

\subsubsection{Concurrency Test}

The concurrency test evaluates the system's ability to handle simultaneous patient monitoring sessions, testing scalability from 100 to 10,000 concurrent patients in increments of 500. This test is critical for determining the maximum patient load the gateway can support in a hospital environment.

\paragraph{Test Design}
The concurrency test employs a multi-threaded approach using Python's \texttt{ThreadPoolExecutor} to simulate realistic concurrent patient scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Patient ID Management}: Implements safe ID allocation within the 1-50,000 range with wrap-around logic to prevent conflicts
    \item \textbf{Burst Transmission}: Sends complete sensor datasets for multiple patients simultaneously
    \item \textbf{Real-time Monitoring}: Tracks system response and performance degradation points
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Timing}: Uses proportional wait times based on patient count to optimize test duration
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Implementation}
The test architecture consists of two main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Patient Burst Generator}: Creates concurrent patient data streams using thread pools
    \item \textbf{Alert Monitor}: Captures and analyzes system responses in real-time
\end{enumerate}

Each test iteration follows this sequence:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Allocate unique patient ID batch within safe range
    \item Launch concurrent threads to send complete sensor datasets
    \item Monitor alert reception with timeout management
    \item Calculate performance metrics (success rate, throughput, response time)
    \item Apply system cooldown period before next iteration
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Metrics and Analysis}
The concurrency test measures several key performance indicators:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Send Rate}: Patients transmitted per second
    \item \textbf{Success Rate}: Percentage of patients generating valid alerts
    \item \textbf{Throughput}: System processing rate (alerts per second)
    \item \textbf{Breaking Point}: Concurrency level where performance degrades below 80\%
    \item \textbf{Recommended Capacity}: Maximum stable concurrent patient load (90\%+ success)
\end{itemize}

The test generates comprehensive results showing system behavior across the full concurrency spectrum, identifying optimal operating ranges and scalability limits.

\subsubsection{Enhanced Performance Testing}

The original performance tests were significantly enhanced with a client-server architecture to provide more accurate and comprehensive system monitoring.

\paragraph{Client-Server Architecture}
The enhanced performance testing framework separates concerns between load generation and system monitoring:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance Client}: Runs on the monitoring host, generates controlled patient loads at specified rates (10-320 patients/minute)
    \item \textbf{Performance Server}: Deploys directly on the gateway host, monitors actual system resources and P4 switch performance
\end{itemize}

This separation ensures that load generation doesn't interfere with system monitoring, providing more accurate performance measurements.

\paragraph{Enhanced Monitoring Capabilities}
The server component provides real-time system telemetry:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CPU and Memory Usage}: Tracks resource consumption patterns
    \item \textbf{BMv2 Process Monitoring}: Monitors P4 switch process health and performance
    \item \textbf{Network Interface Statistics}: Captures packet rates and error conditions
    \item \textbf{HTTP Telemetry}: Provides web-based dashboard for real-time monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mixed Condition Testing}

To better reflect real-world hospital scenarios, both latency and timeout tests were enhanced with mixed patient condition datasets, incorporating samples from normal, sepsis, and heart failure patients.

\paragraph{Mixed Latency Testing}
The enhanced latency test uses balanced datasets from three patient populations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Normal Patients}: Baseline physiological parameters
    \item \textbf{Sepsis Patients}: Elevated inflammatory markers and vital sign abnormalities
    \item \textbf{Heart Failure Patients}: Cardiovascular stress indicators
\end{itemize}

Each test iteration randomly selects from these realistic patient profiles, ensuring the ML prediction algorithms are tested with clinically relevant data patterns. This approach validates both system performance and clinical accuracy under diverse conditions.

\paragraph{Mixed Timeout Testing}
Similarly, the timeout test incorporates mixed patient conditions to evaluate system behavior when sensor data is incomplete across different clinical scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scenario Coverage}: Tests 10 different incomplete sensor patterns (missing 1-9 sensors)
    \item \textbf{Clinical Diversity}: Each scenario tested with all three patient condition types
    \item \textbf{Randomized Execution}: Test order randomized to eliminate temporal bias
    \item \textbf{Condition-Specific Analysis}: Results analyzed by patient type to validate appropriate clinical responses
\end{itemize}

The mixed testing approach provides insights into how the system handles incomplete data across different patient populations, ensuring robust performance regardless of clinical condition severity.

\subsubsection{Accuracy Testing Framework}

Comprehensive accuracy tests were developed to validate ML model performance using real patient datasets, incorporating missing sensor simulation to test robustness.

\paragraph{Dual-Condition Testing}
Separate accuracy tests were implemented for sepsis and heart failure prediction:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sepsis Accuracy Test}: Uses normal vs. sepsis patient dataset
    \item \textbf{Heart Failure Accuracy Test}: Evaluates normal vs. heart failure classification
    \item \textbf{Missing Sensor Simulation}: 10\% random sensor dropout to test real-world robustness
    \item \textbf{Fast Transmission}: Minimized delays between packets for maximum throughput testing
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Performance Metrics}
Each accuracy test generates comprehensive classification metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overall Accuracy}: Percentage of correct predictions
    \item \textbf{Sensitivity/Recall}: True positive rate for condition detection
    \item \textbf{Specificity}: True negative rate for normal patients
    \item \textbf{Precision and F1-Score}: Balanced performance measures
    \item \textbf{Confusion Matrix}: Detailed classification breakdown
\end{itemize}

Results are exported to CSV format for detailed statistical analysis and clinical validation.

\paragraph{Clinical Relevance}
The accuracy tests validate not only technical performance but clinical utility:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{False Positive Analysis}: Ensures minimal unnecessary alerts
    \item \textbf{False Negative Assessment}: Critical for patient safety
    \item \textbf{Condition-Specific Insights}: Performance varies by patient type and severity
    \item \textbf{Missing Data Tolerance}: Validates system reliability with incomplete sensor inputs
\end{itemize}

This comprehensive testing framework ensures the IoT gateway meets both technical performance requirements and clinical safety standards across diverse operational scenarios.
